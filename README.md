IIT Jodhpur Student Body Election Code

Overview

This program simulates a voting system for the IIT Jodhpur Student Body Election. It enables users to vote for their preferred candidates from a predefined list and keeps track of the votes. Once voting ends, the program declares the winner based on the highest number of votes.

Code Structure

1. Header Inclusion

The code includes the header file <stdio.h> for input and output operations.

2. Macro Definition

The macro MAX_CANDIDATES is defined with a value of 25, setting the maximum number of candidates allowed.

3. Struct Definition

A structure candidate is defined to store information about each candidate, using a character array name with a size of 69 characters.

4. Main Function

Key Functionalities:

Initialization:

An array of struct candidate named candidates is initialized with a maximum capacity of MAX_CANDIDATES.

An array arr is used to keep track of the votes received by each candidate.

Voting Process:

The program displays the list of candidates and prompts the user to vote by entering a corresponding number.

The vote count for the selected candidate is incremented.

Termination Condition:

The voting loop terminates when the user enters the code 955.

Winner Determination:

After voting ends, the program calculates the candidate with the highest number of votes and declares them as the winner.

Features

Simple and intuitive interface for users to vote for their preferred candidate.

Keeps track of the vote count for each candidate.

Declares the winner based on the maximum number of votes.

Allows the user to terminate the voting process by entering a specific code.

Improvements

1. Modularization

The code can be modularized by defining separate functions for:

Displaying the candidate list.

Processing the votes.

Determining the winner.

2. Dynamic Candidate List

Instead of hardcoding candidate names in the source code, allow user input to dynamically populate the list of candidates.

3. Enhanced User Interface

Implement a more user-friendly interface with:

Clear instructions.

Feedback messages for invalid inputs.

Conclusion

The program effectively implements a basic voting system for the IIT Jodhpur Student Body Election. While it achieves its primary goal, enhancements in code organization, error handling, and user experience can significantly improve the system's robustness and usability.
